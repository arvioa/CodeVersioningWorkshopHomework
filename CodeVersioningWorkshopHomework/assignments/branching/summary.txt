Danni said branching is...
a command in git to make changes from a version previously saved from a repository.

Branching allows developers to make changes in separate units, creating a safe and controlled changes environment.
Branching also allows developers to work separately from the main project or code, this ensures that changes could be reviewed and evaluated before making it
to production.
